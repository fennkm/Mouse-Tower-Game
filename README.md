# Mouse Tower

*"Us mice have crawled on the ground for far too long! Legend has it that the moon is made of cheese... enough to feed us for generations! Our best engineers have designed a tower to take our people to space - and you're going to help us build it."*

These mice may not be very good builders, but that's not going to stop them. Construct a tower out of toothpicks, thread and spare buttons... but be careful it doesn't topple over!

Manage the stress of your tiny workers and the looming threat of the house cat to smash your high score and reach for the stars! Ramp up production with specialised rooms and come back from the brink of defeat with last-minute tower reinforcements. 

**Don't let the mice down - they're depending on you**
